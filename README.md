Introduction to GitHub

Hi!

Very excited to join the github community!

I am brand new to coding and am very excited to devlop my skills on HTML and CSS (for the time being) and eventually move forward
into learning more complex languages!

I decided to start codingbecause I wanted to challenge myself. I want a job, or even an interesting hobby, that will continue to 
challenge me to learn and develop mysel.

Always interested in making connections and learning from people who have been doing this longer than me!
